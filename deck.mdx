Omio is a global multi-mode search engine for all major forms of transport. We
compare and combine air, bus, rail and ferry journeys for routes both big and
small.

Tell the story!!

Around two years ago when I joined the company, we were facing some architectural but let's see how do we work.

## How do we work?

<Steps>


- ✅ Teams are structured by business needs
- ✅ Micro Frontend
- ✅ Autonomous teams

### But this also comes with some issues ...

<Steps>


- ❌ Integrating all the projects together is quite problematic.
- ❌ Repetitive code and configuration.
- ❌ There is no way to spread a company-wide stack.
- ❌ Every team had to deal with the bootstrap by themself.

When we think about a framework or tool that can help us bootstrap a project in React, most of the people will think of `create-react-app`, and it was our first try!

- easy to bootstrap new projects
- easy to share across the company, one npm dependency
- it keeps all the technologies and configuration in one place
  - webpack
  - eslint
  - babel
  - react
- provide a set of scripts that clients can run:
  - start (also lint your project)
  - build

## `create-react-app` 🤔

- ✅ Quickly bootstrap new projects.
- ✅ Easily share across the company.
- ✅ Keeps all the technologies and configuration centralized.
- ✅ It provides a set of scripts that clients can run.

CRA it's a great library that can help to move faster in projects that match exactly the stack. Which wasn't our case ...

- We were using different technologies to develop Micro frontend
- The only "usable" script was the build ...

We grab the general idea and we decided to create our create-react-app, keeping the same principles. We knew that we wanted to have:

## Framework principles

<Steps>


- 1️⃣ One Dependency
- 🏎 A fast way to bootstrap your project
- 🏠 One place for all the technologies and configurations.
- 📝 Scripts to cover the needs of the teams.

</Steps>

<Notes>


As the initiative was at the beginning to address the problems with Micro Frontend, we decided to call it `frontend-scripts`, AKA `fes`.

# We called it

# ✨ `fe-scripts` ✨

## One Dependency

**`yarn add @goeuro/frontend-scripts`**

---

## A fast way to bootstrap your project

`npx @goeuro/frontend-scripts init`

<Notes>


Our stack is basically

We kept all these technologies inside the `fes` dependencies and `modules` dependencies.

## Scripts to cover the needs of the teams

- 👶 Creation
- 🛠 Development
- 🧪 Testing
- ⚙️ Environment Setup
- 📦 Deployment

---

### Creation

<Steps>


- **init**: bootstrap a new project.

</Steps>


---

### Development

<Steps>


- **storybook-web**: configuration of **Storybook Web** with start and build scripts.
- **storybook-rn**: configuration of **Storybook React Native** with start script.
- **integration-rn**: integrate the project with the **React Native** application to run it locally.
- **lint**: run **ESlint** with the company configuration.
- **update-translations**: fetch the latest translations for your project being used with **React Intl**.

</Steps>


---

### Testing

<Steps>


- **test**: load **Jest** and run integration or unit test for **Web** and **React Native**.
- **e2e-web**: configuration of **Cypress** and run all the End-to-End tests file for **Web**.
- **visual-testing**: run Static Visual Testing from all the **Storybook** stories in **Web**.

</Steps>


---

### Environment Setup

<Steps>


- **run-android**: download the **Android** application, and start the emulator.
- **run-ios**: download the **iOS** application, and start the emulator.

</Steps>


---

### Deployment

<Steps>


- **build**: transpile your project using **Typescript**.
- **deploy-ci**: deploy your project using **semantic-release**.

</Steps>


---

<Notes>


- bootstrap new project with init command
- run help command
- run start storybook web
- run start storybook rn and show it inside the playground (that will be already opened)
- run test
- run e2e-test
- run build command

## How does it work? 🤔

</Invert>


---

## 4 pillars

- #### Templates
- #### Commands
- #### Modules
- #### Core

---

<SplitRight>


```tree
📦templates
┣ 📂react
┃ ┣ 📂src
┃ ┃ ┣ 📂components
┃ ┃ ┗ 📂views
┃ ┣ 📜.npmignore
┃ ┣ 📜.gitignore
┃ ┣ 📜package.json
┃ ┗ 📜yarn.lock
┣ 📂react-redux
┗ 📂react-apollo
```

## Templates

- Project codebase to bootstrap.
- You can have as many as you want.
- Relies on **commands** and **modules**.
- Provide all the basic dependencies.

</SplitRight>


---

<SplitRight>


```tree
📦commands
 ┣ 📜clean.ts
 ┣ 📜help.ts
 ┣ 📜update-translations.ts
 ┗ 📜init.ts
```

## Commands

- Simple scripts to be executed on the client
- They shouldn't require any additional dependency to run.
- They have a beginning and an end.

</SplitRight>


---

<Split>


```javascript
// commands/logger.js
const run = (...args) => {
  console.log('Logging arguments!', args);
};

module.exports = {
  run,
};
```

<Steps>


## Calling the command

<div>


```bash
> yarn fe-scripts logger
# Logging arguments
```

</div>


<div>


```bash
> yarn fe-scripts logger 1 2
# Logging arguments 1 2
```

</div>


</Steps>


</Split>


---

<Notes>


When the clients bootstrap their projects they are not going to install all the dependencies at once.

They only install the dependencies needed to use the project locally and make it work with your IDE.

The rest of the dependencies will come inside the modules.

Therefore when the client wants to execute e2e test, it will get the e2e module, after it will install the needed dependencies and at last it will run the tests.

</Notes>


<SplitRight>


```tree
📦modules
 ┣ 📂build
 ┣ 📂e2e
 ┗ 📂storybook
   ┣ 📂.storybook
   ┃ ┗ 📜main.js
   ┣ 📜.npmignore
   ┣ 📜package.json
   ┗ 📜yarn.lock
```

## Modules

- Self-contained set of **commands**.
- Have to be installed to be executed.
- They can use external dependencies.
- They can have a state.

</SplitRight>


---

<Split>


```json
{
  "name": "my-storybook-module",
  "description": "My simple storybook module",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "start-storybook -p 6006",
    "build": "build-storybook -o ../../static"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.9.0",
    "@storybook/addon-actions": "^5.3.18",
    "@storybook/addons": "^5.3.18",
    "@storybook/react": "^5.3.18",
    "babel-loader": "^8.1.0",
    "react": "^3.20.1",
    "react-loader": "^2.13.6"
  }
}
```

<Steps>


## Calling the module

<div>


```bash
> yarn fe-scripts my-storybook-module
# Copying module into your project
# Installing module dependencies
# Run: start-storybook -p 6006
```

</div>


<div>


```bash
> yarn fe-scripts my-storybook-module:build
# Run: build-storybook -o ../../static
```

</div>


</Steps>


</Split>


---

<SplitRight>


```tree
📦fe-scripts
 ┣ 📂commands
 ┣ 📂modules
 ┣ 📂core
 ┗ 📂templates
```

## Core

- Exposes a CLI to communicate with the tool.
- Decoupled from the others pillars.
- Knows how to execute **templates**, **commands** and **modules**.
- UX for Developers.

So these four characteristics are present in any project of any kind:

And that's why you can create **any** application with this framework!

The only constraint you have is it has to be a node application. Luckily JS is now even on your TV.

## Next Steps 🙌

<Steps>


- Start using the framework in other areas than Frontend.
- Open source the library under [OmioLabs](https://github.com/omio-labs) 🥳

</Steps>


---

## What is it going to include? 🎁

<Steps>


- Decouple **core** and make it extensible.
- Publish existing **modules**, **templates** and **commands**.
- How to use it and development guidelines.
